## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size


### Result

https://stats-preview-by-vrlclk.netlify.app/

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I used

- Grid Template Areas
- Media query for desktop
- The ``<picture>`` and ``<source srcset="">`` element
- Context of an image using the ``alt`` attribute
- BEM naming conventions

### What I learned

- How to add a color on the image (sort of)
- How you can change the opacity of an image
- How ``border-radius`` work and their syntax
- How to assign rules for different photo sizes

### Continued development

- Learn about positioning (relative, absolute)
- Avoid using width and height unless it's required
- Learn where to use containers
- More functions of Grid

### Useful resources

- [Two ways to create an image with a color overlay in CSS](https://dev.to/ellen_dev/two-ways-to-achieve-an-image-colour-overlay-with-css-eio) - I used the first solution. I don't know if this is the right way to put a color on an image because all it does is to change the opacity of the image and not the color.
- [Change the alignment of Grid columns to rows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56385519/how-to-convert-css-grid-template-columns-to-rows-responsively)
- [Values of ``place-items``](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-items) - Compared to ``align-items`` for Flexbox, ``place-items`` uses differently names values but have the same behavior: start is left, center is center and end is right.
